This week in Ocean:

* We launched this blog!
  * A place we're hoping to keep a written record of the 
    Ocean journey - whatever that might be.
* Registered [tryocean.com](https://tryocean.com) and launched a placeholder site.
  * This is exciting because it's officially our first marketing material.
  * Our first major milestone is to build a functional prototype we can put
    in front of our target audience and have them go "Aha! I get it." This
    website will be a critical part of that experience.
* Finished the SNS/SQS implementation of our streams service prototype.
  * We have an internal service which manages all of our streams. 
    This week we finished our first persistant implementation on top of
    Amazon SNS and SQS (with some support from DynamoDB).
